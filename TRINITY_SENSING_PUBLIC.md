WHAT IS TRINITY SENSING?

Core Concept

Trinity Sensing uses three-qubit geometric quantum structures to achieve measurable sensitivity advantages over standard quantum sensors. The "trinity" refers to fundamental three-element arrangements that provide unique quantum mechanical advantages.

Why Three Qubits?

Geometric Advantages:

• Triangular symmetry creates natural resonance structures

• Closed loops enable cyclic quantum evolution

• Minimal geometric structure for non-trivial quantum effects

Quantum Advantages:

• Genuine 3-body entanglement (cannot be reduced to qubit pairs)

• Berry phase (geometric phase) only appears in cyclic evolution

• Smallest multi-body system showing true quantum complexity

• Topological protection from certain types of noise

Physical Advantages:

• Minimal qubit overhead (only 3 qubits required)

• Achievable on current quantum hardware

• Scalable to multi-trinity arrays for enhanced performance
